# Passivity_Based_Control for vehicle dynamics and wheeled quadruped robots based on energy shaping

This repo was part of my Advanced controls project at Clemson Univesity. 

We develoepd a passivity based controller to stabilize a qarter car model in the presence of uknown disturbaces using ideas from energy shaping nas passivity. 

We extened this formulation for a wheeled quadruped robot.
